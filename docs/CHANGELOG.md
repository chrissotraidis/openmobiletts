## 2026-02-20 — v2.0.1: Comprehensive Bug Fixes and Hardening

Comprehensive code review across all three components (Android, client, server) identified and fixed 40+ issues including race conditions, resource leaks, thread safety bugs, and security vulnerabilities.

### Android Fixes

**Critical:**
- `TtsManager.kt` — Replaced `@Synchronized` (deadlock on suspend) with coroutine `Mutex`; added `@Volatile` on `tts` field
- `AacEncoder.kt` — Fixed MediaCodec leak: moved `configure()`/`start()` inside `try` so `finally` always releases; added `INFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT_CHANGED` handler
- `ModelDownloader.kt` — Added Zip Slip protection (canonical path check); moved connection disconnect to `finally` block
- `MainActivity.kt` — Moved `saveAudioFile` disk I/O to background thread (was blocking JavaBridge)

**High:**
- `TtsService.kt` — Added `@Volatile` on `instance`; API-version-guarded `stopForeground`
- `AppLog.kt` — Fixed thread-unsafe `SimpleDateFormat` with `ThreadLocal`
- `TtsHttpServer.kt` — Added `cancelled` check in QueueInputStream read loop; capped request body at 1 MB
- `VoiceRegistry.kt` — Replaced manual JSON string building with `JSONArray`/`JSONObject`

### Client Fixes

**Critical:**
- `player.js` — Fixed blob URL leak on error (added `revokeObjectURL` + null refs in catch block)
- `audioCache.js` — Fixed `initDB` concurrency with promise caching; `removeCachedAudio`/`clearAudioCache`/`cleanupCache` now properly await transactions via `oncomplete`/`onerror`

**High:**
- `AudioHistory.svelte` — Fixed download to use native Android bridge (`playerStore.downloadAudio`); added post-loop buffer flush for last audio chunk
- `history.js` — Fixed ID collision with monotonic counter (`Date.now() * 1000 + counter`)
- `+page.svelte` — Log export uses native bridge download; speed slider has `touch-action: manipulation`

### Server Fixes

**Critical:**
- `main.py` — Fixed concurrent upload filename collision (UUID prefix); null filename validation; extension validation before disk write; broader exception handling (`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`, `OSError`); version corrected to `2.0.0`

**High:**
- `tts_engine.py` / `sherpa_backend.py` — Fixed falsy bug: `speed or default` treats `0.0` as falsy; replaced with `is not None` checks
- `document_processor.py` — Added `errors='replace'` for UTF-8 text file reading
- `text_preprocessor.py` — Fixed zero-token estimation for short sentences (`max(1, ...)`)

## 2026-02-19 — v2.0.0: Android WebView + Native TTS Bridge + Cleanup

Replaced Capacitor WebView wrapper with a native Android app that loads the SvelteKit web app in a WebView, backed by an embedded NanoHTTPD server bridging to on-device Sherpa-ONNX TTS. Removed all Capacitor dependencies and old Compose UI.

**Added:**
- `android/` — WebView-based Android app with embedded HTTP server
- NanoHTTPD server: serves SvelteKit static build + API endpoints on localhost:8080
- Sherpa-ONNX TTS engine with Kokoro INT8 model (~95 MB) for on-device inference
- VoiceRegistry (53 voices), WavEncoder (PCM to WAV), TtsHttpServer
- TtsService foreground notification for keep-alive during generation
- Model download on first launch with progress UI
- `android/copy-webapp.sh` build script + Gradle `bundleWebApp` task
- `docs/ANDROID_ARCHITECTURE.md` — WebView architecture documentation

**Removed:**
- Jetpack Compose UI (19 files: data/, viewmodel/, ui/ directories)
- Compose dependencies from build.gradle.kts
- `client/android/` — Capacitor WebView wrapper
- `client/capacitor.config.ts` — Capacitor configuration
- Capacitor dependencies (`@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/cli`, `@capacitor/android`)
- `docs/ANDROID_APP_GUIDE.md`, `docs/OFFLINE_TTS_FEASIBILITY.md`, `docs/MIGRATION.md`

---

## 2026-02-18 — v1.0.0: Android Support

Added Android support with configurable server URL and CORS middleware.

**Added:**
- Configurable server URL in Settings (for remote clients)
- Test Connection button with 5-second timeout and status feedback
- CORS middleware on FastAPI (`allow_origins=["*"]`) for cross-origin requests
- `apiUrl()` helper in `api.js` — all fetch calls route through configurable base URL

---

## 2026-02-17 — Documentation Overhaul

Updated all documentation to reflect the monolithic architecture (v0.2). Removed outdated references to JWT authentication, CORS, separate client/server processes, port 5173, default credentials, and two-terminal startup. Files rewritten: QUICK_REFERENCE.md, SETUP_GUIDE.md, HOW_IT_WORKS.md, implementation-status.md, technical-architecture.md, testing-summary.md, SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md, docs/README.md, DOCUMENT_PURPOSES.md.

---

## 2026-02 — Monolithic Migration (v0.2)

Redesigned from a two-process client-server architecture to a single-process monolithic app. Redesigned from two-process client-server to single-process monolithic app.

**Removed:**
- JWT authentication (no login, no passwords)
- CORS middleware (same origin)
- Separate client dev server (port 5173)
- `src/auth.py` module
- Environment variables: JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH

**Added:**
- `run.py` — Single-command launcher
- `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` — Multi-stage Docker build
- Static file serving (FastAPI serves built SvelteKit UI)
- Single port (8000) for everything

---

## 2026-01-30 — v0.1 Fixes

**Issues Fixed**: 3 major issues

---

## Issue 1: Model Download/Installation ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Kokoro TTS models were not explicitly downloaded/cached in the repo
- No clear instructions for model setup
- Models downloaded on first use, which could be confusing

### Solution
1. **Created `setup_models.py`** - Automated setup script
   - Downloads Kokoro models to `~/.cache/kokoro/`
   - Tests TTS generation to verify setup
   - Shows cache location and file sizes
   - Checks Python version and espeak-ng

2. **Updated server README** - Clear setup instructions
   - Step-by-step model download process
   - Model cache location documented
   - Expected file sizes noted (~100MB)

### Usage
```bash
cd server
python setup_models.py
```

Models are cached at: `~/.cache/kokoro/`

**Note**: Models also download automatically on first use, but the setup script ensures everything works correctly.

---

## Issue 2: Streaming Playback Not Working ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- MP3 file downloaded but didn't play in browser
- Audio playback component not receiving audio
- Streaming response parser was corrupting MP3 data

### Root Cause
The client was trying to decode binary MP3 data as UTF-8 text, which corrupted the audio. The original parser:
```javascript
// BROKEN: Decodes all data as text, corrupts MP3 binary
const text = new TextDecoder().decode(value);
```

### Solution
**Rewrote `TextInput.svelte` streaming parser** to properly handle binary data:

1. **Binary-safe buffer management**
   - Uses `Uint8Array` instead of text strings
   - Preserves binary MP3 data integrity

2. **Smart metadata extraction**
   - Scans for `TIMING:` markers in byte stream
   - Extracts JSON metadata as text
   - Removes timing lines from buffer
   - Collects remaining bytes as MP3 audio

3. **Proper blob creation**
   - Concatenates audio chunks as binary
   - Creates valid `audio/mpeg` blob
   - Generates playable object URL

### New Parser Logic
```javascript
// Parse streaming response properly
const reader = response.body.getReader();
const audioChunks = [];
const timingData = [];
let buffer = new Uint8Array(0);  // Binary buffer

while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();

    // Combine with existing buffer (binary safe)
    const combined = new Uint8Array(buffer.length + value.length);
    combined.set(buffer);
    combined.set(value, buffer.length);
    buffer = combined;

    // Extract TIMING: lines (decode only metadata)
    // Keep MP3 data as binary
    // ...
}

// Create valid audio blob from binary chunks
const audioBlob = new Blob(audioChunks, { type: 'audio/mpeg' });
```

### Result
- ✅ MP3 plays correctly in browser
- ✅ Audio quality preserved
- ✅ Timing metadata extracted successfully
- ✅ Synchronized text highlighting works

---

## Issue 3: No Audio Caching/History ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- No way to replay previously generated audio
- Audio lost after page refresh
- Poor mobile UX without history

### Solution
**Created IndexedDB-based caching system:**

1. **`audioCache.js` service** - IndexedDB wrapper
   - `saveAudio()` - Cache generated audio
   - `getAllAudio()` - Get history (sorted by timestamp)
   - `getAudio()` - Load specific audio by ID
   - `deleteAudio()` - Remove from cache
   - `clearCache()` - Clear all cached audio

2. **`AudioHistory.svelte` component** - History UI
   - Lists all cached audio (newest first)
   - Shows text preview, timestamp, voice, speed
   - "Play" button to load audio
   - "Delete" button to remove from cache
   - Auto-refresh on mount
   - Relative timestamps ("5m ago", "2h ago")

3. **Auto-caching in `TextInput.svelte`**
   - Automatically saves after generation
   - Stores: text, audioBlob, timingData, voice, speed, timestamp
   - Non-blocking (doesn't fail generation if cache fails)

### IndexedDB Schema
```javascript
{
  id: auto-increment,
  text: string,
  audioBlob: Blob,
  timingData: array,
  voice: string,
  speed: number,
  timestamp: number
}
```

### Features
- ✅ Persistent storage (survives page refresh)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (IndexedDB works on mobile)
- ✅ Efficient storage (binary blobs)
- ✅ Fast retrieval by ID or timestamp
- ✅ Clean UI with relative timestamps
- ✅ Delete individual items
- ✅ Play cached audio without regenerating

---

## Additional Improvements

### Voice Options
Added all 11 Kokoro voices to UI:
- Female: Heart, Nova, Sky, Bella, Sarah
- Male: Adam, Michael
- British Female: Emma, Isabella
- British Male: George, Lewis

### Updated Player Page
Added history component below audio player:
```svelte
<AudioHistory />
```

### Build Status
✅ Client builds successfully (1.47s)
✅ No critical errors
⚠️  Minor accessibility warnings (non-blocking)
